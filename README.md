# Hacker Mode Scripts
## Fake hacker scripts to make people think you are a hacker - for Unix-like systems with Bash installed.

Place these scripts somewhere in your PATH if you want to run it from anywhere.

There are currently 4 scripts. I'll likely add more. 

hm1 requires nms (No More Secrets) to be installed.

I'll likely write an installation script and menu for this soon. I just wanted to get these scripts up quickly tonight.
